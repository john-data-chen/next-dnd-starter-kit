## 📦 Core Framework Versions Decision

- Next.js: ^14.x (Production-ready version with stable App Router. I will postpone upgrade to 15.x until it is more stable)
- React: ^18.x (Awaiting better ecosystem and packages support for 19.x)

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Press **Use this template** to create a new repository.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.

### Database

- In production and CI, I use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database)
- In local development, I use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) in folder **database**, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) installed.

### Environment Configuration

Local Development:

Create a `.env (.env.test for testing)` file in the project root with the following variables:

```text
# Application Environment
# Options: default: development | production | test: for testing
NODE_ENV=development

# Authentication Secret
# Required: A secure random string for JWT token encryption
# Generate: openssl rand -base64 32
# Warning: Keep this value private and unique per environment
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[your_secret]

# Database Connection
# Format: mongodb://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?[options]
# Required fields:
# - username: Database user with appropriate permissions
# - password: User's password (URL encoded if contains special characters)
# - host: Database host (localhost for development)
# - port: MongoDB port (default: 27017)
# - database: Database name (next-project-manager)
# - options: Additional connection parameters (authSource=admin required)
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?authSource=admin"
```

Production and CI:

Create environment variables in Vercel or GitHub project settings.

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Generate Secret
echo "NEXTAUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" > .env

# start mongodb in docker
cd database
docker-compose up -d

# initialize mongodb
pnpm init-db

# stop mongodb (in database folder)
docker-compose down

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Run unit and integration tests by Vitest
pnpm test

# Run E2E tests by Playwright
pnpm playwright

# ESLint
pnpm lint

# Format code
pnpm format
```

## 🔐 Permission System

### Core Concepts

- Board can have multiple projects, it is the biggest container
- Project can have multiple tasks, it is the smallest container
- Each board has one owner and multiple members
- Tasks can be assigned to any member
- All modifications of a task are tracked with last modified user

### User Roles & Permissions

| Role         | Create Board | Delete Board | Edit All Projects | Delete Project (Cascade Tasks) | Create Project | Create Task | Edit All Tasks | Edit Own Task | Delete All Tasks | Delete Own Task | View All Projects & Tasks |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Board Owner  | ✔️           | ✔️           | ✔️                | ✔️                             | ✔️             | ✔️          | ✔️             | ✔️            | ✔️               | ✔️              | ✔️                        |
| Board Member | ✖️           | ✖️           | ✖️                | ✖️                             | ✔️             | ✔️          | ✖️             | ✔️            | ✖️               | ✔️              | ✔️                        |

> Note:
>
> - Board Owner has all permissions, including creating, deleting, and editing all projects and tasks.
> - Board Member can only create projects and tasks, and can only edit and delete their own projects and tasks, but can view all content.

### Task Operations

- Task creator and assignee can edit task
- Only owner of board, owner of project and creator of task can delete tasks
- Task status: To Do → In Progress → Done

## 📖 Detailed Technical Documentation

### 📊 Testing Strategy

- Cross-browser testing (by Playwright) ensures functionality across desktop and mobile.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### React/Next.js

- **Radix UI Ref Warning**:

  - Issue: Function components cannot be given refs warning in Dialog components
  - Impact: Development warning only, no production impact
  - Solution: Keep using `asChild` as per Radix UI docs, warning can be safely ignored
  - Reason: Internal implementation detail of Radix UI

- **Radix UI ARIA Warning**:
  - Issue: Blocked aria-hidden on a <body> element warning in Dialog components
  - Impact: Development warning only, no production impact
  - Solution: Can be safely ignored as most modern browsers handle this correctly
  - Reason: Internal implementation of Radix UI's Dialog component

### ESLint

- **ESLint 9.x Type Issues**:
  - Issue: Type incompatibility with @types/eslint
  - Solution: Use type assertions or @ts-ignore for specific cases
  - Status: Waiting for type definitions to catch up with ESLint 9.x

### Server

- **Slow response from server**:
  - Issue: Sometimes Server response is slow
  - Status: The resource of free tier is limited, it won't be fix in the near future
